# Coding Problem-Solving Questions

1. Problem Statement:
   You are tasked with analysing health insurance claims data represented in a JSON format. The data includes information about patients and their associated claims.
   The goal is to extract insights and analyse patterns in the claims data.

Tasks:

1. Extract Related Claims
   o Part A: Write a function to extract all claims related to a given claim ID.
   o Part B: Write a function to find the maximum claim amount in the last &#39;n&#39; days for a given patient ID.

2. Merge Claim Data
   o Part A: Write a function to merge claims for a specific patient and billing code.
   o Part B: Write a function to find the most frequently occurring billing code for a given patient ID.

3. Filter Claims by Date Range
   o Part A: Write a function to filter claims for a given patient within a specific date range.
   o Part B: Write a function to find the length of the longest contiguous subarray of claims with the same billing code for a given patient ID.

4. Group Claims
   o Part A: Write a function to group claims by patient age and treatment type.
   o Part B: Write a function to determine if there exists a valid sequence of billing codes where each subsequent code is greater than the previous
   one.

5. Analyze Fraud Patterns
   o Part A: Write a function to identify patterns of potential fraud repeated claims for the same billing code
   o Part B: Write a function to find the first unique billing code for a specific patient.

## Solution

approach taken to address the problem, along with the rationale behind the choices made:

1. Modular Function Design

Each task was implemented as a standalone function. This approach ensures reusability, testability, and separation of concerns, making it easier to debug or enhance individual functionalities without affecting others.

2. Use of Built-in Libraries

datetime: Used to handle date calculations, ensuring robust and accurate processing of date-related queries (e.g., filtering claims by date or finding maximum claim amounts in a specific timeframe).

collections.Counter: Used for counting occurrences of billing codes efficiently, which is crucial for determining the most frequent billing codes and identifying patterns of potential fraud.

itertools.groupby: Used for grouping consecutive claims by billing code, simplifying the implementation of tasks like finding the longest contiguous subarray.

3. Data Traversal and Filtering

Functions were designed to traverse the JSON structure efficiently, iterating over patients and their claims only as needed. This ensures that the solution scales reasonably with the size of the input data.

4. Handling Edge Cases

Default return values (e.g., None for empty results) were included to ensure robustness, especially when the data doesn't meet specific criteria (e.g., no claims in the last n days or no unique billing codes).

5. Grouping and Aggregation

Tasks like merging claims and grouping by patient age and treatment type were implemented using dictionaries to map keys (e.g., billing codes or age-treatment pairs) to aggregated results. This choice simplifies both implementation and access to grouped data.

6. Fraud Detection Logic

Patterns of repeated claims for the same billing code were identified using Counter, which allows for easy detection of overused billing codesâ€”a common indicator of fraud.

7. Sequence Validation

For the sequence validation task, a simple comparison loop was used to ensure clarity and performance when checking for valid billing code sequences.
