# Technical design questions:

1. Data Structure Choice:
  Which data structures would you use to efficiently store and retrieve the top 10 clicked products, and why?

  A hashmap (dictionary) to store click counts, where the key is the product_id and the value is the number of clicks.
  A min-heap of size 10 to efficiently retrieve the top 10 clicked products.

  #### Answer:
  The hashmap provides O(1) time complexity for recording clicks.
  The min-heap ensures O(log 10) time complexity for maintaining the top 10 clicked products, making it efficient for real-time updates.

2. Efficiency and Scaling:
  How would your solution scale with an increasing number of unique products?

  #### Answer:
  The hashmap grows linearly with the number of unique products, and its lookup and update remain O(1).
  The min-heap ensures that only the top 10 products are retained, regardless of the total number of products.
  Time and Space Complexity:

2.1 Discuss the time and space complexities of your approach. 

  #### Answer:
  Time Complexity:
  record_click: O(1) for updating the hashmap and O(log 10) for updating the heap.
  get_top_10_clicked_products: O(10 log 10) for retrieving and sorting heap elements.

  Space Complexity:
  Hashmap: O(n) for n unique products.
  Min-heap: Constant O(10) for storing the top 10 products.

3. Concurrency Handling:
  How would you manage concurrent updates to click counts in a web application with thousands of concurrent users?

    #### Answer:
    Use a thread-safe counter (e.g., Python's collections.Counter with thread locks) to handle updates.
    Alternatively, implement sharded counters for distributed environments, where each shard handles a subset of products and aggregates results periodically.
    Use a read-write lock to allow multiple concurrent reads while ensuring write operations are atomic.

4. Latency vs Consistency:
   How would you balance real-time updates with eventual consistency?

    #### Answer:
    Real-time updates: Use in-memory storage (e.g., Redis) to reduce latency for click updates and top 10 retrievals.
    Eventual consistency: Periodically persist click counts from memory to a database to ensure durability and recoverability.
    A combination of caching and batching can optimize for both latency and consistency.

5. Extensibility:
    How would you modify the design to track additional metrics like purchases or views in the future?

    #### Answer:
    Use a generalized data structure like a hashmap of dictionaries to track multiple metrics:

    click_data = {
      "product_id_1": {"clicks": 100, "purchases": 50, "views": 200},
    }

    Extend methods to filter or sort based on any metric.
    Use an abstraction layer to define metric-specific update and retrieval logic.

6. Data Persistence and Recovery:
   How would you ensure the click data persists and can be recovered in case of a system crash?

    #### Answer:
    Use a persistent key-value store (Redis, DynamoDB) for real-time storage.
    Periodically back up the hashmap to a database (PostgreSQL, MySQL).
    Implement a recovery mechanism to load data from the database into memory upon system restart

7. Testing Strategy:
   How would you test your implementation to ensure correctness, thread safety, and performance?

    #### Answer:
    Test that record_click updates counts accurately.
    Test that get_top_10_clicked_products always returns the correct top 10 products in sorted order.

    Concurrency Tests:
    Use tools like Python's threading module or stress-testing tools to simulate thousands of concurrent updates.
    Verify correctness under race conditions.

    Performance Tests:
    Measure latency for click recording and retrieval under high loads.
    Test with a large number of unique products to ensure scalability.

8. Monitoring and Alerts:
   What monitoring metrics and alerts would you set up to ensure the system is functioning as expected?

    #### Answer:
    Total number of clicks processed.
    Average latency for record_click and get_top_10_clicked_products.
    Memory and CPU usage of the service.

    Alerts:
    High latency or error rates in API calls.
    Memory usage exceeding a threshold.
    Discrepancies between in-memory and persistent data.
    Use tools like Prometheus or Datadog for monitoring, and integrate with Slack or email for alerts.
